 Algorithmer

 Overview
Algorithmer is an advanced web application for graph and binary tree simulation and visualization, designed with a three-layer architecture and utilizing TypeScript libraries. The application allows users to model, simulate, and animate popular algorithms in an intuitive and interactive manner.

 Features
 Graph Simulation
- Graph creation: Build custom graphs by clicking and connecting nodes interactively.
- Algorithm visualization: Simulate and animate the following algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A Algorithm

 Binary Tree Builder
- Tree creation: Create custom binary trees using:
  - Keyboard input
  - REST API calls
- Data flexibility: Accepts various data types such as numbers, strings, or JSON.

 Additional Highlights
- Template-based design ensuring simplicity and clarity.
- All functionalities integrated on a single web page.
- Clean and attractive user interface (UI) for enhanced usability.

 Why Algorithmer?
Algorithmer distinguishes itself from competitors through:
- Template-based architecture ensuring ease of use.
- Unified interface: All operations available on a single web page.
- Visually appealing and intuitive UI: Minimizing the learning curve for users.

 Architecture
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:

- Frontend: Built with HTML and TypeScript (index.html, index.tsx).
- Backend: Implemented using Express.js.
- Database: JSON-based data handling.

 Supported Structures and Algorithms
- Binary Trees:
  - Red-Black Trees
  - AVL Trees
  - BFS Trees
- Graph Algorithms:
  - A
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
